## Project Objective

The objective of PIW Acoustic Localization is to leverage sound detection technology to create a cost effective direction-finding system that will aid maritime
search and rescue operations. By utilizing buzzer, hydrophones, radio communication, signal processing we are able to detect and locate general location of
buzzer transmitted through water to increase effectiveness of search and rescue mission.

## Weekly Assessment
*All tasks will also be listed in the projects in [**SoundSAR-Capstone**](https://github.com/orgs/macee/projects/2/views/1) under **macee***
### Overall Current Team Tasks
1. Create mission needs statement and concept of operation for project
2. Create 30 dB gain amplifier for hydrophone by implementing an operational amplifier

#### Accomplished Tasks
1. Project abstract
2. Inital concept of machine operation (protocols, communication methods, etc..)

### Individual Tasks
#### Matt Go
##### Ongoing Tasks
1. Find Software Defined Radio software package for Adafruit Feather M4 Express Microcontroller
2. Research BNC-3.5mm jack adapter for connecting dyrophone to Adafruit microcontroller
3. Research LoRa (Long Range) supported microcontroller for Radio communication between the sensor and the host.

#### Pat Ober
##### Ongoing Tasks
1. Draft mission needs statement document
